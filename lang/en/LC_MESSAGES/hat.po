"The Hat is the fun and hilarious word game you can play with your friends!\n"
"\n"
"First of all - split into 2 teams: every team must contain 2+ members.\n"
"\n"
"The main idea is to guess words from your friend's clues or explain them on "
"your turn before the time runs out. While first team is playing the second "
"is waiting for it's turn.\n"
"\n"
"If the word was guessed press the \"Guessed!\" button and this word will fly "
"away from the Hat and your team will get +1 score point. Otherwise if the "
"word is too hard for you right now - press the \"Skip...\" button and this "
"word will stay in the Hat until it will be guessed.\n"
"\n"
"The game will continue until every word will be guessed.\n"
"\n"
"There are 3 rounds in the game: TALK, PANTOMIME and ASSOCIATIONS. You will "
"see short description of each of them during the game. In every new round "
"the words come back to the Hat from the previous round.\n"
"\n"
"Wins the team that gets more score points.\n"
"\n"
"That's all!\n"
"Have fun!"
